#Mike Quinn notes

##Main Scene
- I would like to see more prefabs in your scenes. While working by yourself, changing the actual scene works fine
but as you start working with teammates you will run into an issue where changing the scene causes major conflicts.
The way around this is to have prefabs for all objects that may need to be updated. So get into the habbit of 
prefabbing all of your objects and then get into the workflow of updating the prefabs instead of the scene.

- I do like your separation and organization within the scene but take the extra step and prefab these objects.

- I'd suggest that you switch the HUD to overlay as your current system won't scale to different screen sizes

##Final Notes
- Way too many singletons. The point of a singleton is to only have one instance of an object for conflict reasons
or to have scene persistent data. Your MonoBehaviour class are already the only instance of an object in the scene
so setting your single instance objects as singletons is not good practice and will lead to more difficulty in debugging.
You can have the same effect by setting references to other classes within a serialized field in the editor.

- Use namespaces. Not only is this a standard requirement to avoid naming conflicts but you it will force you to address
the interconnection between your classes.

- Overall it's not bad, there are sections where the code can be formatted better but there isn't anything that screams intervention.

Keep up the good work and feel free to stay in touch!
